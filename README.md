# TeamProject-JSApplications
This is a team project for JSApplications course module. 
  The project consists of a web application developed with the React framework and JavaScript, also using Bootstrap for styling. The application
is a book library where the user can list, add, edit, delete and sell books. You must first be logged in or register to be able to implement the
functionality. The application is using Kinvey as a back-end service for storing the data and users.

The following is the specifitactions as per requrements by SoftUni:

  1. Technologies
For the project development you must use:
JavaScript – your main functionality must be in JS
AJAX, REST and communication with the back-end
ReactJS for rendering the templates for the UI
Models, Views, Controllers, Services, Helpers and Entities for the main functionality
HTML & CSS – you must provide some normal UI for the user
You may use CSS generating frameworks like Bootstrap etc.
Kinvey – as your back-end, use the Kinvey API, since it is the easiest and most appropriate to use
Optionally you are allowed to use something different from ReactJS for the template rendering, or Kinvey, for the back-end logic, but these 2 are closest to the course’s target, so they are highly recommended.
